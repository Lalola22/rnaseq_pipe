# Analysis of RNA-seq data

All code used to analyse RNA-seq data for $PAPERNAME are contained within this repository.

Running the script `wrapper.sh` on raw-read `.fastq.gz` data in an environment with all dependencies installed will be sufficient to recreate analysis.

All programs used need to be added to the PATH
